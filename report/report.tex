\begin{abstract}
This paper describes an implementation of the lottery scheduler in the
xv6 operating system. Lottery scheduling is a process scheduling
mechanism that randomly chooses a process to run based on its tickets
(just like a lottery). The more tickets one process have, the higher the
probability of it being chosen by the scheduler. In the code presented
here, the Binary Indexed Tree (BIT, or Fenwick Tree) is used to
efficiently count every process' amount of tickets. Then we analyze the
scheduler behavior by looking at what order a group of processes with
the same task, but different amounts of tickets, finish their job.

\section{Introduction}
The xv6 operating system is a simple Unix-like teaching operating
system developed by MIT and widely used in Operating Systems classes all
over the world. In our class, we were assigned to implement the
lottery scheduler on xv6, which initially had a basic First-In-First-Out
scheduler. Every time the scheduler was to choose a process to run, it
would linearly search through the array of processes looking for the
first process that is ready, starting at the previously used index.

The lottery scheduler is a probabilistic scheduler algorithm that works
similarly to a real world lottery. Every process is given a certain
amount of tickets and the scheduler randomly picks one of the available
tickets among all processes. The process holding the chosen ticket is
then picked to be run by the processor in the next quantum. This way, we
can think of a process that have a high quantity of tickets as having a
high priority, as it has a high probability of being chosen by the
scheduler and it will thus be run more frequently than a process that
have less ticekts.

\section{The lottery scheduler} \label{sec:lottsched}
In order to implement the lottery scheduler, a few changes were needed in
some data structures used by xv6. The first modification was in the
\texttt{proc} structure, found in the \texttt{proc.h} file, in which it
was added the \texttt{tickets} attribute to hold the quantity of tickets a process was given.

\begin{scriptsize}
\begin{verbatim}
// Per-process state
struct proc {
  uint sz;                     // Size of process memory (bytes)
  pde_t* pgdir;                // Page table
  char *kstack;                // Bottom of kernel stack for this process
  enum procstate state;        // Process state
  int pid;                     // Process ID
  struct proc *parent;         // Parent process
  struct trapframe *tf;        // Trap frame for current syscall
  struct context *context;     // swtch() here to run process
  void *chan;                  // If non-zero, sleeping on chan
  int killed;                  // If non-zero, have been killed
  struct file *ofile[NOFILE];  // Open files
  struct inode *cwd;           // Current directory
  char name[16];               // Process name (debugging)
  int tickets;                 // Quantity of tickets assigned to this process
};
\end{verbatim}
\end{scriptsize}

Some other modifications made in the code relate to the \texttt{ptable}
structure, found in the \texttt{proc.c} file: the \texttt{deadstack}
array, \texttt{top} and \texttt{tickets}:

\begin{scriptsize}
\begin{verbatim}
struct {
  int deadstack[NPROC], top;
  int tickets[NPROC + 1];
  struct spinlock lock;
  struct proc proc[NPROC];
} ptable;
\end{verbatim}
\end{scriptsize}

** WORK IN PROGRESS **

The way that a process is given a \texttt{pid} was also
modified. Initially, xv6 started with the variable \texttt{nextpid},
found in the \texttt{proc.c} file, set to 1. Every time a process is
created, it would be given that \texttt{pid} and \texttt{nexpid} is
incremented. In this implementation with lottery scheduler, a stack
called \texttt{deadstack} was created to store all the currently
available \texttt{pid}s and whenever a new process is created, it will
be identified by the \texttt{pid} found in the top of this stack. This
was done to use the \texttt{pid} to index both the processes array and the BIT array.

To keep track of every process' tickets, the \texttt{ptable.tickets} array,
found in the \texttt{proc.c} file, was created to be used as a
Binary Indexed Tree (BIT, also known as Fenwick Tree) to efficiently
count how many tickets there are up until a given process (among all
existing processes). This way, we can binary-search our tree until we find the leftmost position \texttt{i} in the \texttt{ptable.tickets} array which
sums greater than or equal to the ticket that was picked this time
around. This position in the BIT is the chosen process \texttt{pid}
and is also its position in the \texttt{ptable.proc} array.
